            we'll use one of the respondWithErrorStatus methods to return an error condition to the caller, in this case,
            a status code of 400 (Bad Request).
            
            Note that the respondWithErrorStatus methods all take the response object, the reponseReturn block and the requestComplete
            block. This is because the respondWithErrorStatus constructs an appropriate NSHTTPURLResponse object, and calls
            the reponseReturn and requestComplete blocks for you. Once a respondWithErrorStatus method is called, the performRequest
            method should not continue processing and should always return.

        We use the serviceIdentifier property here rather than the string "singlelocation" as a general best practice of
        avoiding hard-coded strings in multiple places.
        
        In addition, we expect the query string to be nil, as no query parameters are expected in this call.
        
        In your own services you may want to be more lenient, simply ignoring extra path or parameters.

    The methods "registered" and "unregistered" are optional in the ServiceProtocol protocol. They are called when your service
    is registered/unregistered in the ServiceRouter. The ServiceRouter controls which services are available in the system.
    When a service is registered it is then capable of receiving requests. When it is unregistered it will no longer receive requests.
    While services themselves are stateless, there may be times when they utilize non-stateless components, or need to prepare
    something in the system environment prior to being used. These methods allow for that type of interaction.
    For this example service we will not use them.
